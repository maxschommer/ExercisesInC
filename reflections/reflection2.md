#Written Sprint Reflection

My goal this sprint was to balance better my work on the project and work on exercises, and also to have more regular meeting times with the rest of the team to work on the project. I also wanted to separate teem meeting times to be just project work, because we could do the exercises on our own. 

During the previous sprint, I made an effort to communicate a lot more via our communication channel (messenger for us). that meant that I sent a message every time I would start working on the project, and would send messages periodically to update on progress being made on the project, so that none of my teammates were in the dark about what was going on. I also sent several requests for team meetings so that we could work more togeather as a team on the project, because I was worried about the progress on our project, knowing what we've done, how long it took, and what we had left to do. 

I also worked for around 20 hours over the sprint on the project, and wrote around 250 lines of code. What went poorly is that I felt that I was the only one working on the project, and that my teammates were somewhat unresponsive to messages sent. I also felt that, even though I admit sometimes I sent out messages for meeting times that were late at night or didn't work for everyone, there was no attempt from my teammates to make any other meeting to work on the project. I don't think we will have a very good project at the rate we are going, since I don't have the time to finish the project entirely by myself.

We now have the problem that, since I've worked so much on it, I am also the one who understands the code the most (which isn't beautiful since it's still in a state of work). I'm not sure if I work less on the project, whether its possible for the rest of the team to build off of what I've made to create an integrated product in time. I think a lot of what I'm going to be doing in the future will be not coding myself, but pair programming with my teammates to get them more comfortable with the code and how everything works so they can work independantly on the project.

I worked on Ch3 and Ch4 this sprint. For Ch4, I wasn't able to get the code to compile properly once I broke the main function into a separate file, and asked several peers about it, who said it looked like I was doing it correctly.

#Exam Question

What is the difference between printf(), and fprintf()? Why would you use one over the other?

###An answer

printf() is a generalized form of fprintf(), whos output is stdout. fprintf() allows you to print to any specified output, which means that all of the power of datastreams is at your disposal. printf(), however, is usually better for most cases because stdout is what is desired. If you want to print errors, or to a different data stream, fprintf() is what you should use.
